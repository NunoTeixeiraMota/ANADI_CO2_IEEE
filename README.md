# Patterns and Predictions of CO2 Emissions 🌍💨📊

Welcome to our comprehensive project repository, where we delve deep into the patterns and predictions of CO2 emissions, spanning from the early 20th century to the present day. This project utilizes a blend of historical data analysis, statistical modeling, and predictive insights to shed light on the trajectory of CO2 emissions in Portugal, Spain, and key global regions, aiming to contribute significantly towards environmental policy formulation and climate action strategies.

## About This Project 📘

This study, developed by José Teixeira and João Morais from the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, explores CO2 emissions in Portugal and other selected regions from 1900 to 2021. Through rigorous data analysis and statistical techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical Inference, Correlation Analysis, and Linear Regression Modeling, we compare emission trends, identify significant patterns, and predict future trends. This project aims to provide actionable insights for more informed and effective environmental policies.

## Technologies Used 💻🔬

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for data visualization, including line charts, histograms, and heatmaps.
- **SciPy & Statsmodels**: For advanced statistical tests, including t-tests, ANOVA, and regression analysis.

## Key Findings and Insights 📈

- Comparative analysis of CO2 emissions per capita between Portugal and Spain, revealing Spain's higher carbon footprint.
- A detailed sector-wise analysis of emissions in Portugal, emphasizing the significant contributions from cement production, coal combustion, gas, and oil.
- The development and application of a linear regression model to predict Europe's emissions based on emissions from key countries.
- Identification of significant disparities in CO2 emissions among major global emitters and insights into the effectiveness of regional environmental policies.
